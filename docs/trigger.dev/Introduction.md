What is Trigger.dev (v3)?
-------------------------

Trigger.dev v3 makes it easy to write reliable long-running tasks without timeouts.

*   We run your tasks with no timeouts. You don’t have to manage any infrastructure (unless you [self-host](https://trigger.dev/docs/open-source-self-hosting)). Workers are automatically scaled and managed for you.
*   We provide a multi-tenant queue that is used when triggering tasks.
*   We provide an SDK and CLI for writing tasks in your existing codebase, inside [/trigger folders](https://trigger.dev/docs/config/config-file).
*   We provide different types of tasks: [regular](https://trigger.dev/docs/tasks-regular) and [scheduled](https://trigger.dev/docs/tasks/scheduled).
*   We provide a dashboard for monitoring, debugging, and managing your tasks.
*   We provide a [Realtime API](https://trigger.dev/docs/realtime) for monitoring tasks in real-time, along with [React hooks](https://trigger.dev/docs/frontend/react-hooks#realtime-hooks) for building custom dashboards.

We’re [open source](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev) and you can choose to use the [Trigger.dev Cloud](https://cloud.trigger.dev/) or [Self-host Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev/docs/open-source-self-hosting) on your own infrastructure.
